bad-golf-community-edition
==========================
**Bad Golf: Community Edition** is a community developed realisation of Patrick Hackett's "Bad Golf" pitches from Double Fine's 2012 and 2014 Amnesia Fortnight events, aiming to capture and celebrate the reckless shenanigans that less professional golfers can get up to when they're left alone with a golf cart.

See the AF pitch that started it all:
